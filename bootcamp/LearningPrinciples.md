It's very important to setup communication 'protocol' between trainee and mentor
Let's start with next important topics

## How to ask Questions

>>Place a rubber duck on your monitor and describe your problems to it. There's something magical about stating your problems aloud that makes the solution more clear.

I have a question and I'm writing it to someone... but not sending it. In the moment when
you 'transfer' the question from your mind to some medium (paper, email, chart, [thinking out loud](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThinkingOutLoud)) it turns on other parts of your brain and in next 5-10 minutes answer comes. Nine times out of ten. Amaizing thing is that you find solution **themself** and
without spending time of **others**.

Note that 

Question shouldn't contains **NO/NOT** 

* do NOT know
* can NOT, 
* NOT possible
* NO time
* NO experience
* etc

Instead it should be *open* and contains 

* How
* Where
* How much
* Who
* When
* etc

Questions like

* Why
* What for

Dangerous becuase motivate to find guilties. In case of addreset to themself could drop you in
deep recourcive self-analyze

This effect amound programmers called `Teaddy Bear Effect` or [`Rubber Duck`](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking)

You may remember when you are starting describ problem to someone but instead find solution whithout any output from your partner. 

Let's summarize to

####Simple algorithm 

1. You have a question
1. Describe it in details to somebody how can give an answer, use some medium (email, chat, paper, etc)
1. All statement with **NO/NOT** replace with How, Where, Who etc.

####Example

Joe, I **can not** install this library to the project ?

Rewrite to

Joe, **How can** I install this library to the project ?

Re-read it and switch from the question to other activity: play in billiard, tenis, drink a cup of tea ...
or just go for a walk. The main idea is to not think about question. You even can take another task for a while.
If after 10-15 mins no any `insight` then you can ask question your colleges.

#####Use your mind on 100%

> Remeber, if question appears in your mind, then answer alread there, you just need to find it ...


## Time managment

1. All your working day ( N hours) should be prepared and stored at your repository
2. During planing, please, take to accaunt recomendations from this article
3. Don't spend more time on the task then it requires
4. Always clarify time dedicated for the task
5. Task has to be like "Do something in 5 hours" but not "Do something"
6. If you spend more time then expected then inform your mentor
7. Work on task before the first blocker. Once blocker appears inform your mentor as early as possible. If no any corrections/suggestions/instruction then switch to other task
8. Acceptable to spend some extra time to eliminate blocker themself, let's say 10..30 mins.
Mentor desides if you have to spend more time
9. Write all complited actions and occured problems. It would be ground for increasing time limit for the task
10. Try to complite as much tasks as possible
11. Absence of time isn't a reason in cases like: "I was working on task A that's why haven't done task B". Exceptions are 
	* dependent tasks, when incoplete A is a blocker for B. 
	* tasks with explicitly set highest priority where output is concrete result
12. Try to work evenly. For example you have a task for 6 hour but delivery is in 3 days, it's ok to split for 2 hours per day. Work on few tasks simultaniously each day by combining complex and easy tasks
13. Lear to effectively use timeframes for parforming small sub-tasks. For example
	* build of the project
	* execution of tests
	* docs/email
	* TODO 
14. If you **naturally** can't work on few tasks simultatiously, don't hesitate and inform your mentor
15. There are 4 categories of tasks
	* urgent important
	* not urgent important
	* urgent and not important
	* not importatn and not urgent
16. If you have done all urgent and important tasks for current iteration, take a look in future materials and try to prepare sketch plan for it, then go back for learned section and read additional materials like articles,books or bonus tasks.

## Daily Report

1. Trainees create their personal `daily plans` at the end of the day or in the morning and put them to their repository
1. A plan includes a list of tasks to be done on the following day. 
	* It is a good idea to mark higher priority tasks and put such tasks first. 
	* The plan should include estimation of how much time will be spent on the task.
1. Trainee should pay attention to individual plans provided by mentors. Tasks assigned by mentors have higher priority compared to the ordinary trainee program.
1. Mentors should perform daily check of the trainee's plan and correct it if needed.
1. At the end of the day trainees create `daily reports` (work logs). A report lists what have been done, how much time was spent, any issues related to the tasks. All blockers should be clearly marked as well.
