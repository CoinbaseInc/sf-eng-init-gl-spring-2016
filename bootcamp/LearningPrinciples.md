## How to ask Questions

>>Place a rubber duck on your monitor and describe your problems to it. There's something magical about stating your problems aloud that makes the solution more clear.

I have a question and I'm writing it to someone... but not sending it. In the moment when
you 'transfer' the question from your mind to some medium (paper, email, chart, [thinking out loud](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThinkingOutLoud)) it turns on other parts of your brain and in next 5-10 minutes answer comes. Nine times out of ten. Amaizing thing is that you find solution **themself** and
without spending time of **others**.

Note that 

Question shouldn't contains **NO/NOT** 

* do NOT know
* can NOT, 
* NOT possible
* NO time
* NO experience
* etc

Instead it should be *open* and contains 

* How
* Where
* How much
* Who
* When
* etc

Questions like

* Why
* What for

Dangerous becuase motivate to find guilties. In case of addreset to themself could drop you in
deep recourcive self-analyze

This effect amound programmers called `Teaddy Bear Effect` or [`Rubber Duck`](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking)

You may remember when you are starting describ problem to someone but instead find solution whithout any output from your partner. 

Let's summarize to

####Simple algorithm 

1. You have a question
1. Describe it in details to somebody how can give an answer, use some medium (email, chat, paper, etc)
1. All statement with **NO/NOT** replace with How, Where, Who etc.

####Example

Joe, I **can not** install this library to the project ?

Rewrite to

Joe, **How can** I install this library to the project ?

Re-read it and switch from the question to other activity: play in billiard, tenis, drink a cup of tea ...
or just go for a walk. The main idea is to not think about question. You even can take another task for a while.
If after 10-15 mins no any `insight` then you can ask question your colleges.

#####Use your mind on 100%

> Remeber, if question appears in your mind, then answer alread there, you just need to find it ...
