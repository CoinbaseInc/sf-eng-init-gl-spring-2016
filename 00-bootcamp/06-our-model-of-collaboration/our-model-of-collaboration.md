**[<= Back](../05-git-and-github/tools-for-development.md)**		*	*	*	**[Next =>](../../01-syntax/00-intro/intro.md)**

## Idea

Setup such model of collaboration which would  allows constant evolution and improvements of
learning content, tools and processes.

## Technical Details

## Open-source like model of collaboration

### Trainee to Mentor

1. Trainees are doing exercises in their forks and pull request them to mentor for review
    * [task is completed](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TaskCompleteDefinition) only if mentor merged it to his repository and closed corresponding issue
1. Trainee merges his competed tasks from mentor's repo after each milestone
1. Trainees may contribute to learning program but providing pull request to mentor's master branch

### Mentor to Trainee

1. Mentor provides some updates in course content, like additional info or exercises
