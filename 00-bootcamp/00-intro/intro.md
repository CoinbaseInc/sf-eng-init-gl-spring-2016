### Markdown Syntax

1. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Practice

#### Exercise 1  

You may have some problem in workflow or UI bug, one of the way to explain is to create `screenshot` or record `screencast`

>Use `Jing` for that

1. Imagine that you have broken layout at you application and need help from someone
    * create screenshot
    * create issue with label `bug`
    * provide sreenshot as image in description to your issue
1. Imagine that you have a problem with some new tool or workflow
    * create screencast
    * create issue with label `question`
    * provide screencast as link in description to your issue

#### Exercise 2

You requested to prepare article about benefits of Agile Development vs Waterfall Development.
Looks like article would consist of headings, paragraphs, links, lists and quotes, there are maybe images or even tables
After some analise, you understand that pain text isn't your choose because it's too featureless and `HTML` is too verbose, 
so you decided to use `markdown` syntax. Write that article with as much markdown features as possible. 

> Don't use markdown features blindly, use them where they make sense
