>Place a rubber duck on your monitor and describe your problems to it.
There's something magical about stating your problems aloud that makes the solution more clear.

I have a question and I'm writing it to someone... but not sending it. In the moment when
you `transfer` the question from your mind to some `medium` (paper, email, chart, [thinking out loud](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThinkingOutLoud)) 
it turns on other parts of your brain and in next 5-10 minutes answer comes. 
Nine times out of ten. Amazing thing is that you find solution `themselves` and without spending time of `others`.

Question shouldn't contains **NO/NOT** 

* do NOT know
* can NOT, 
* NOT possible
* NO time
* NO experience
* etc

Instead it should be *open* and contains 

* How
* Where
* How much
* Who
* When
* etc

Questions like

* Why
* What for

Dangerous because motivate to find guiltier. In case of addresses to themselves could drop you in deep recursive self-analyze

This effect among programmers called `Teddy Bear Effect` or [`Rubber Duck`](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking)

You may remember when you are starting describe problem to someone but instead find solution without any output from your partner. 

Let's summarize:

##### Simple algorithm 

1. You have a question
1. Describe it in details to somebody how can give an answer, use some medium (email, chat, paper, etc)
1. All statement with **NO/NOT** replace with How, Where, Who etc.

##### Example

Joe, I **can not** install this library to the project ?

Rewrite to

Joe, **How can** I install this library to the project ?

Re-read it and switch from the question to other activity: switch to other task, play in billiard, tennis, drink a cup of tea ...
or just go for a walk. The main idea is to not think about question. You even can take another task for a while.
If after 10-15 mins no any `insight` then you can ask question your colleges


##### Use your mind on 100%

> Remember, if question appears in your mind, then answer already there, you just need to find it ...
